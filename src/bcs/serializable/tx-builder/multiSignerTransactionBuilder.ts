   * Largely the same as @see generateRawTransaction, this function mainly serves to simplify the process by storing the raw transaction in the class fields.
   *
   * The main difference is that we require *all* of the information up front and store it, that way the developer doesn't have to worry about
   * the rest of the transaction builder flow.
   *
   * Ideally, this function is wrapped and called solely by auto-generated code that determines how many secondary signers are possibly for a given function, given its abi inputs.
   *
   * NOTE: The `sender` address passed in will be the first `&signer` in the Move function signature.
   * If there are any secondary `&signer` arguements, their order is determined by the order of the secondary signer addresses input here.
   * @param args.sender The address of the account that will appear as the first `&signer` in the Move function signature
   * @param args.secondarySignerAddresses The addresses of the accounts that will appear as the secondary `&signer` arguments in the Move function signature
   * @param args.feePayerAddress The address of the account that will pay the transaction fee, if unspecified, this will be `0x0`
   * @param args.payload The transaction payload
   * @param args.aptosConfigOrNetwork The AptosConfig or Network that will be used to generate the transaction
   * @param args.options The options that will be used to generate the transaction
